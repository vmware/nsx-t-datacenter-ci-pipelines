# nsx-t-datacenter-ci-pipelines
This repository provides an easy-to-use automation framework that installs and configures NSX-T on vCenter clusters where PKS and/or PAS can be deployed.

## Overview
Under the hood, there is a Concourse pipeline which is to be set up by a Docker container which the user creates. The Concourse pipeline is in turn run in three Docker containers: DB, worker, and web container.

The Concourse pipeline performs the following jobs:
1. Deploy NSX manager, controllers and edges;
2. Convert hosts from vCenter clusters specified by user to NSX transport nodes;
3. Create NSX logical resources to make the environment PAS/PKS deployment ready.

## For the full documentation see the wiki page
See the wiki: https://github.com/vmware/nsx-t-datacenter-ci-pipelines/wiki

## Try it out
On a Ubuntu VM with at least ~20GB of space,
```
wget https://github.com/vmware/nsx-t-datacenter-ci-pipelines/raw/master/docker_image/nsx-t-install-05202019-ua.tar -O nsx-t-install.tar
docker load -i nsx-t-install.tar
mkdir -p /home/concourse
```
Create nsx_pipeline_config.yml based on a sample config file, e.g. https://github.com/vmware/nsx-t-datacenter-ci-pipelines/blob/master/sample_parameters/PAS_only/nsx_pipeline_config.yml for PAS environment, and place it under /home/concourse.
```
docker run --name nsx-t-install -d \
  -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
  -v /home/concourse:/home/concourse \
  -e CONCOURSE_URL='http://<host_ip>:8080' \
  -e EXTERNAL_DNS='<dns_server>' \
  -e IMAGE_WEBSERVER_PORT=40001 \
  -e VMWARE_USER='<myvmware_user_email>' \
  -e VMWARE_PASSWORD='<myvmware_password>' \
  nsx-t-install
```
Set CONCOURSE_URL to http://<host_ip>:8080 (host_ip is the IP address of the primary NIC of the VM running the container (example: 10.85.99.130); it is not the loopback address. Set EXTERNAL_DNS to the DNS server (it should be able to resolve the vCenter hostname, and public names e.g. github.com), and IMAGE_WEBSERVER_PORT to the port number provided in the nsx_pipeline_config.yml parameter nsx_image_webserver (recommendation: 40001).

The above command will automatically download the ovftool (e.g. VMware-ovftool-4.3.0-xxxxxxx-lin.x86_64.bundle) and NSX OVA (nsx-unified-appliance-2.4.0.0.0.xxxxxxx.ova) files from myvmware.com. If you have already downloaded the two files manually, place them under /home/concourse, and you can run above command with VMWARE_USER and VMWARE_PASSWORD skipped. By default, the docker image from master/nsxt_2.4.0 branch downloads nsx ova version 2.4.0. If deploying earlier version (e.g. NSX-T 2.3.0), simply add `` -e NSXT_VERSION=2.3.0 `` in the docker run command above, or use the docker image from nsxt_2.3.0 branch.

---
__If running the pipeline on existing concourse environment and not using the nsx-t-install image, please perform following additional steps:__ in nsx_pipeline_config.yml that was created under /home/concourse, add the following lines at the beginning:
```
nsxt_ansible_branch=master
nsx_t_pipeline_branch=master
```
if deploying NSX-T 2.4.0 or later, or
```
nsxt_ansible_branch=v1.0.0
nsx_t_pipeline_branch=nsxt_2.3.0
```
if deploying NSX-T 2.3.0 or earlier.
Also, if ovftool and ova files were downloaded manually, add ``ova_file_name=<ova_file_name>`` and ``ovftool_file_name=<ovftool_file_name>`` in nsx_pipeline_config.yml as well.

---

Browse to the Concourse pipeline: http://<CONCOURSE_URL>/teams/main/pipelines/install-nsx-t/ (example: http://10.85.99.130:8080/teams/main/pipelines/install-nsx-t/) and click on the plus on the upper right corner to trigger a build to install NSX-T. If you are prompted with a username and password, use 'nsx' and 'vmware'.
